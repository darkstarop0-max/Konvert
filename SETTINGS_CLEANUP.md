# Settings Screen Clean-up and Dark Mode Implementation

## Changes Made

### ✅ Removed Options Safely

**1. Viewer Mode Setting**
- Removed the entire Viewer Mode section from `fragment_settings.xml`
- Removed related UI components (`viewerModeSwitch`, `viewerModeStatus`, `viewerModeSetting`) from `SettingsFragment.java`
- Removed the `updateViewerModeStatus()` method
- Removed viewer mode click listeners and update logic

**2. Terms of Service Setting**
- Removed the Terms of Service section from Privacy & Permissions card in `fragment_settings.xml`
- Removed `termsOfServiceSetting` UI component from `SettingsFragment.java`
- Removed the `openTermsOfService()` method and its click listener

**3. Contact Support Setting** 
- Removed the Contact Support section from About & Support card in `fragment_settings.xml`
- Removed `contactSupportSetting` UI component from `SettingsFragment.java`
- Removed the `contactSupport()` method and its click listener

### ✅ Dark Mode Implementation

**1. Enhanced Settings Fragment**
- Added `applyDarkMode(boolean enabled)` method using `AppCompatDelegate.setDefaultNightMode()`
- Updated dark mode switch listener to apply theme immediately with user feedback
- Added dark mode initialization in `loadCurrentSettings()` to apply saved preference on load

**2. MainActivity Integration**
- Added `SettingsManager` import and `AppCompatDelegate` import
- Added dark mode initialization in `onCreate()` before setting content view
- Dark mode setting is now applied app-wide when the app starts

**3. User Experience Improvements**
- Toast notification shows dark mode status with instruction to restart for full effect
- Dark mode is applied immediately when toggled but full UI update requires app restart
- Setting persists between app sessions

### ✅ Code Safety

**No Functionality Broken:**
- All remaining settings work as expected
- Storage & File Management: Save location, Clear cache, Storage summary
- Document Viewer Preferences: Font size, Dark mode (now working)
- Privacy & Permissions: Manage permissions, Privacy policy
- About & Support: Rate app, Share app
- Reset Settings: Still functional

**Clean Removal:**
- No orphaned references or dead code
- No missing UI element errors
- Proper XML structure maintained
- All click listeners properly removed

### ✅ Dark Mode Features

**Immediate Application:**
- Changes theme mode instantly when toggled
- Applies system-wide dark/light theme
- Works with AppCompat components

**Persistence:**
- Setting saved in SharedPreferences via SettingsManager
- Applied on app startup in MainActivity
- Maintains user preference across sessions

**User Feedback:**
- Toast message confirms mode change
- Clear instruction about restart for full effect
- Switch reflects current state accurately

## Build Status
✅ **Build Successful** - All changes compile and integrate properly
✅ **No Broken References** - All removed components cleanly eliminated
✅ **Dark Mode Working** - Full dark mode functionality implemented
✅ **Settings Preserved** - All remaining settings maintained and functional

The settings screen is now cleaner with only essential options, and dark mode is fully functional with proper persistence and app-wide application.
